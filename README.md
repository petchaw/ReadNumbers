READ NUMBERS
================

This class accepts a number entered in the form of digits and converts that number to its alpha version
================

Purpose
-------
This is an experimental project.  The code is ugly but I will soon clean
it up and add comments.  This class can be user in application where you
want to read numbers to the user.

For example if a user entered 25, the program will output "twenty five"
So in an application to actually read out loud to a user, you may want
to get the output and play the wav file "twenty.wav" then "five.wav"
