================

This class reads the string of numerals and out put the alphabetic version:
E.g.
input : 1234
output: one thousand two hundreds thirty four

================

Purpose
-------
This is an experimental project.  The code is ugly but I will soon clean
it up and add comments.  This class can be user in application where you
want to read numbers to the user.

For example if a user entered 25, the program will output "twenty five"
So in an application to actually read out loud to a user, you may want
to get the output and play the wav file "twenty.wav" then "five.wav"

Method description
------------------
Currently there are 3 useful methods to work with in this class

readNum(): Displays the output on the screen

getOutput(): Returns the output in a string

getArray(): Returns the output in an array
